History and Roadmap {#HistoryRoadmap}
====================


\section roadmap Roadmap

The following features are planned for future releases:

- __Support for Future Pinball__
Not sure yet how this could be done, but it is definitively something I want to see in the framework.

- __Ultimarc PacDrive and Pacled64 support__<br/>
Ultimarc makes some nice output controllers. SUpport for those controllers will be added to the framework as soon as possible.

- __Support for WS2811 based led stripes__<br/>
I have already installed some of those stripes in my cabinet and I want to be able to control them through DirectOutput. So this is a must!<br/>
Check the following video to get a idea what those stripes can do:</br>

- __DMX support__<br/>
DMX is the industry standard protocol used to control stage lighting and effects. There is a huge number of light effects supporting DMX available on the market. DMX support will allow for the use of any DMX device, no matter if it is small or large.<br/>
The first thing which will be implemented for DMX support is Art-Net a protocoll allowing to control DMX lighting effects over ethernet.
