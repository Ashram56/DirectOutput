History and Roadmap {#HistoryRoadmap}
====================


\section roadmap Roadmap

Here are a few of the things which are planned for future releases:

- __Support for WS2811 based led stripes__<br/>
I have already installed some of those stripes in my cabinet and I want to be able to control them through DirectOutput. So this is a must!<br/>
A prototype controller board for the stripes is already working nicely. DOF integration will be next.<br/>
Check the following video to get a idea what those stripes can do:</br>

- __Ultimarc PacDrive support__<br/>
Ultimarcs PacLed64 is already supported by the framework. Support for the smaller PacDrive will be available soon.


- __Support for Future Pinball__
Not sure yet how this could be done, but it is definitively something I want to see in the framework.
