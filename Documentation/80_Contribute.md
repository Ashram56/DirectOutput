Contribute {#contribute}
==========

There are many ways how you can contribute to the DirectOutput framework:

\section contribute_bugs Report bugs and issues

Please report bugs and issues in the DirectOutput framework!

If you report a bug, please include as much information as possible. A simple "DirectOutput doesnt work on my system" message will not help much. The following information might be helpfull to track down and fix bugs:

- Information about your system (operating system, connected hardware).
- Used software (DirectOutput version, B2S.Server version, Visual Pinball version, Pinmame version and so on).
- Exception message/s (most exception messages are recorded on the log files of Directoutput).
- Table in which the bug occured (if more than one table version exists, dont forget to include the version number or a link to the table). 

Bugs and issues can be reported as follows:

- The prefered way of bug reporting is the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DirectOutput/DirectOutput/issues/new">create a issue</a> on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DirectOutput/DirectOutput/">Github page</a> of the DirectOutput framework. Creating a new issue on GitHub requires a login on Github, but creating accounts on Github is easy to create and free.
- If you are feeling really uncomfortable about GitHub, you can also report bugs through the DirectOutput support forum in the VpUniverse site.

Important!
----

- Please check the reported issues on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DirectOutput/DirectOutput/issues?state=open">GitHub</a> and VPForums, to find out if a specific issue has already been reported, before creating a new issue. Thanks!
- Before reporting a issue, please check if you are using the latest version of the framework.

\section contribute_squashbugs Squash some bugs

Found a bug in the code and know how to write code? Great! Help the project be sqashing some bugs. Just download the source code and you are ready to go. More information can be found on the documention page on \ref sourcecode


\section contribute_help Share your knowledge

Some users might have problems installing, configuring and using the framwork. If you already feel familiar with the framework, please consider helping other users by ansering their questions in the various virtual pinball forums. This will free up resources on the development side!


\section contribute_scripting Create scripts

The DirectOutput framework can be extended using C# script files. Using scripts you can create new effects, toys and output controllers. 

General information on scripting for the DirectOutput framework can be found on the following page: \rel scripting

Create more effects
--

The DirectOutput framework can be extended easily with more effects. If you know a bit about C# (not that hard to learn), you might want to start implementing some cool effects for the framework. More information on effect creation and samples can be found on documentation page on \rel fx

Add more and better toys
--

Toys represent all the cool gadgets that you have installed in your cabinet. If you find that a toy is missing or requires a better implementation, you are very welcome to contribute some code using the built in scripting capabilities. More information on the implemention of toy scripts can be found on the documentation page on \rel toys

Add more output controllers
--

If you are using a output controller which is not yet supported by the framework, it would be great if you add support for it. You can find more information on the page on \rel outputcontrollers.


\section contribute_docu Contribute the to documentation

If you think that something important is missing in the documentation on DirectOutput, just help by adding what you consider important. 

- If you have forked the source code (see the docupage on source code for details), you can add you contribution directly to the DirectOutput project and file pull request on Github to make it available for the project.
- You are also welcome to add documention pages, if you are not working with the source code. Just forward your contribution to one of the  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DirectOutput?tab=members">members of the DirectOutput project</a> so it can be included in the project.


\section contribute_source Contribute to the source code

The source code of the DirectOutput framework is freely available on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DirectOutput/DirectOutput/">GitHub</a>.

You are more than welcome to download, analyze, modify, improve or extend the code. The best way to do this is to fork the source code (using Git), so you can easily upload your changes back to GitHub. More information can be found on the documention page on \rel sourcecode
