\section effects_introduction Introduction 

Effects are the parts which are connecting the Table and its TableElelement objects to the Toy objects in the Cabinet object. 
While toys are thought to be relatively stupid and just capable of doing a few simple things (e.g. set a LED to a specific color), effects should do the more complex operations (e.g. dimming the color of a LED from one color to another).

Effects are tiggered by TableElement objects (e.g. a switch or a lamp) changing its state or value and also by the Table itself when the Table is started. 


\section effects_builtineffects Builtin effects 

The DirectOutput framework includes some built in effects. Please check the class documentation for details on the effect classes and their members.

The chapter on table configuration contains configuration samples and more detailed information on most effects.

\section effects_customeffects Custom effects 


The DirectOutput framework can easily be extended to support your own custom effects.
Effects have to be coded in C# and need to reside in the correct location so the can be discovered be the framework (see documentation on Global Config for details). 
There is no need to compile the effects before they are put in use. They are compiled and integrated into the framework during runtime after the have been loaded.

\subsection effects_implementationguideline  Implementation guidelines for custom effects

* All effects must implement the _IEffect_ interface. This interface specifies some methods, properties and events which have to be implemented for every effect.
* Try to inherit the abstract _EffectBase_ class. _EffectBase_ implements the necessary Name property, the change events for the name as well as the Finish method (virtual). 
* Define a unique name for your effect class. This name will also be used when a config file is loaded or saved. If the name is not unique loading or saving will probably fail.
* Ensure that your effect class is XMLSerializable. As a rule of thumb, your class must implement a paramaterless constructor and all settings for the effect have to be available through public properties.
* Bear in mind that the _Trigger_ method might be called with _null_ instead of a _TableElement_ if the effect is assigned as a static effect. Make sure you effect doesn't fail in this situation.
* Be fault tolerant and handle all errors if necessary. In particular keep care that no exception is thrown, if the toy which is specified by its name in your effect is of a wrong type.
* If your effect needs timed events, register for the alarm function of the _Alarms_ object in the _Pinball_ object. This will ensure that the necessary update functions are called and at the same time make sure that no unnessecary update calls to output controllers are triggered. 
* Comment your code! At least the public methods and properties of your effect should be properly documented with XML comments.
