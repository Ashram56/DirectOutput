Credits
=======

The implementation of this framework would not have possible without the work of some other authors:

B2S Direct BackglassServer
--------------------------
Many thanks to Stefan/<a href="http://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showuser=57523">Herweh</a> for his Direct B2S-Server. Without his idea and his work I would probably never have come up with the plan to build this framework.
