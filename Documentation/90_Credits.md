Credits
=======

The implementation of this framework would not have been possible without the work and help of some other people. I'd like to thank the following persons and companies for their support of this project:

B2S Direct BackglassServer
--------------------------
Many thanks to Stefan/<a target="_blank" href="http://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showuser=57523">Herweh</a> for his Direct B2S-Server. Without his idea and his work I would probably never have come up with the plan to build this framework.

Thanks a lot for allowing me to use the B2S.Server as a host for DirectOutput and for enduring my endless requests for features and changes!

Testing and support
-------------------
Many thanks go to some folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://vpuniverse.com/">VPUniverse.com</a>. Arngrim, Bent98, Deegor, Bill55, Slydog43 and SirCheddar have contributed a lot of help during testing and development. Without their support, I would probably never have finished the project and without their testing it would for sure be no where as stable as it is now. 

Thanks for all the help. It has been my pleasure to work with you!
