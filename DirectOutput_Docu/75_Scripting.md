\section scripting_guidelines Scripting guidelines

- Document your code. We all know the saying "It was hard to write, so it should be hard to understand as well", but this is definitvely not the goal of the DirectOutput project. You dont need to document every line of code you write, but at least the public function and the classes shoud be documented. The prefered way of code documentation are XML comments (have a look at the source code of the framework or one of the scripting examples to get a idea).
