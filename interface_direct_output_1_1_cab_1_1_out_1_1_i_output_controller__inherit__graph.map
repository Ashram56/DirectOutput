Using Art&#45;Net it is possible to connect a very wide range of lighting effects like strobes or dimmer packs. There are tons of DMX controlled effects available on the market (from very cheap and small to very expensive and big). It might sounds a bit crazy, but with Art&#45;net and DMX you could at least in theory control a whole stage lighting system (this would likely make you feel like Tommy in the movie)." alt="" coords="670,6,853,47"/>

Only units using the chip in bitbang mode are supported by this output controller class. The SainSmart USB relay boards (http://www.sainsmart.com/arduino&#45;compatibles&#45;1/relay/usb&#45;relay.html) are compatible with this output controller, but other hardware which is based on the same controller chip might be compatible as well. Generally controller units which is exclusively using the FT245R (no extra cpu on board) and having max. 8 output ports are likely to be compatible. Please let me know, if you have tested other hardware successfully, so I can ammend the docu." alt="" coords="657,137,865,178"/>
