Using Art&#45;Net it is possible to connect a very wide range of lighting effects like strobes or dimmer packs. There are tons of DMX controlled effects available on the market (from very cheap and small to very expensive and big). It might sounds a bit crazy, but with Art&#45;net and DMX you could at least in theory control a whole stage lighting system (this would likely make you feel like Tommy in the movie)." alt="" coords="654,6,837,47"/>

Since the outputs of the unit are constant current drivers providing 20ma each, smaller leds can be connected directly to the outputs, but booster circuits might be used to driver higher loads (e.g. Cree leds). Up to 4 PacLed64 controllers can be used with the DirectOutput framework." alt="" coords="656,211,835,253"/>
